🧾 React Todo App

This is a simple and interactive Todo List web application built with React.js as my first React project.
It helps users easily manage their daily tasks with options to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as finished — all while keeping data saved automatically using the browser’s localStorage.
The app is designed with a clean, responsive layout using Material UI components, focusing on simplicity and usability. Each feature demonstrates a practical understanding of React hooks (useState, useEffect) and component-based architecture.
